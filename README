AEPHEM is an astronomical ephemeris and reduction C library, with python
bindings. It is compatible with JPL ephemerides. It has routines for the 
standard astrometric reductions, conversions between different time standards
and transformations between coordinate systems.

AEPHEM is based on aa by Stephen Moshier (http://www.moshier.net) and has
adapted routines from ephcom (http://ephemeris.com).

The library is fully documented using doxygen.  Documentation is available
online at http://aephem.adh-sj.info; alternatively, you can make a local
copy by running doxygen on doc/aephem.dox (you might want to change the
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY).

AEPHEM is distributed under the GNU General Public License, which is included in
this package in the file COPYING.
