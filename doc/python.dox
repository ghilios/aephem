//! \page python_bindings Python Bindings
//!
//! <tt>AEPHEM</tt> includes <tt>python</tt> bindings. These come complete with
//! docstrings, meaning that there is <tt>help()</tt> available in
//! <tt>python</tt>; in time perhaps this documentation will be included here.
//!
//! In general, the <tt>python</tt> functions are similar to the C functions.
//! An example is included in the <tt>demo</tt> directory of the <tt>AEPHEM</tt>
//! distribution.
